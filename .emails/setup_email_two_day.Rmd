We're looking forward to welcoming you to the RSE Sheffield training session on **`r params$course_title`**


### SETUP

Prior to attending, you need to **install the software we are going to use and create an account on GitHub. <span
style="color: #d1410c;">Please ensure you have completed setup before the course begins.</span>**

Instructions on how to create the account as well as install all the software required can be found on the [**Setup
Section**](https://fair2-for-research-software.github.io/git-collaboration/#setup) of the course materials. If you have
any problems with your setup, please get in touch with us for assistance *before* the course begins.


### SCHEDULE

We’ll **kick off at `r params$event_day1_start` on
(`r format(strptime(params$day1, format = "%Y-%m-%d"), "%a %b %d %Y")`)** in **`r params$venue_day1`**
and aim to have a few breaks throughout the morning, finishing at `r params$event_day1_finish`. The second session
will follow **at `r params$event_day2_start` on (`r format(strptime(params$day2, format = "%Y-%m-%d"), "%a %b %d
%Y")`)** in **`r params$venue_day2`** and follow the same format finishing at `r params$event_day2_finish`.

There will be some time at the end of each day for questions and discussions.


### ATTENDANCE

**In the event that you can no longer make it, we please ask that you cancel your ticket so we can offer it to someone on the waiting list**.

<!-- **NB** Please note we will _not_ be in the same venue on the second day. -->

<br>

See you next week!

Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me with any questions.

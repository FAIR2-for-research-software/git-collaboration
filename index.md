# Git Collaboration

Welcome to the _Git Collaboration_ course material.

This course seeks to help with that by building on a basic understanding of Git from courses such as
[Software Carpentry: Git Novice][swCarpentryGit] and
[Git and GitHub through GitKraken : From Zero to Hero!][zeroHero] and going into
  a bit more depth about the way in which Git works and how it can be effectively used for collaboration. The course
  covers the concepts of branches and working with them, effective Git hygiene that helps you write informative commit
  messages and keep branches tidy and provides advice on undertaking constructive Pull/Merge Reviews.

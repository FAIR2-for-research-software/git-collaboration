# Git Collaboration

Welcome to the _Git Collaboration_ course material.

This course aims to help you develop a deeper understanding of how Git works to facilitate collaboration. It builds on
foundational Git courses such as [Software Carpentry: Git Novice][swCarpentryGit] and [Git and GitHub through
GitKraken : From Zero to Hero!][zeroHero].

The core idea around which the course is based is to improve your understanding of working with branches and how to
make a clean Git history in terms of commits and pull requests which in turn makes it easier to collaborate and work on
code with others (including your future self!).

The course is split into six episodes. The first introduces how to customise the configuration of your Git repository
and how to make informative and atomic commits which makes it easier to read and understand the history. The next topic
covered is branches, how switch between branches, moving around the history of a branch, correcting commits made to the
wrong branch and stashing work in progress. Once branches have been understood we cover how to handle diverging
branches. Finally the concept of Git hooks are introduced along with the Pre-Commit framework and how these can be
leveraged in Continuous Integration closes the course.

Welcome to the _Git Collaboration_ course material.

[Git][git] is, in 2024, the most widely used version control system by far. It was developed by Linus Torvalds to manage
[Linux kernel][linux] development and since then has exploded. Websites such as [GitHub][GitHub] and [GitLab][gitlab]
make asynchronous collaboration on common code bases possible and underpin many, many software projects from enterprise
grade tools such as the aforementioned [Linux kernel][linuxGithub], the increasingly popular [Rust][rustGitHub] through
to niche products such as [Snapcast][snapcast] or Android apps for tracking your exercise such as
[OpenTracks][openTracks].

Git and Forges, online repositories for working with version control, as GitHub, GitLab and others such as
[SourceHut][sourcehut], [Codeberg][codeberg] and so forth are known are wonderful tools for, but because of the
complexities of version controlling software in distributed, collaborative environments the tool itself has become quite
complex. There are many different tasks that one may wish to undertake and often several different ways of achieving
these.

This course seeks to help with that by building on a basic understanding of Git from courses such as
[Software Carpentry: Git Novice](swCarpentryGit) and
[Git and GitHub through GitKraken : From Zero to Hero!][zeroHero] and going into
  a bit more depth about the way in which Git works and how it can be effectively used for collaboration. The course
  covers the concepts of branches and working with them, effective Git hygiene that helps you write informative commit
  messages and keep branches tidy and provides advice on undertaking constructive Pull/Merge Reviews.

# Git Collaboration

Welcome to the _Git Collaboration_ course material.

In order to use Git effectively to collaborate with others it helps to understand how the tool you are using works. This
course builds on foundational Git courses such as [Software Carpentry: Git Novice][swCarpentryGit] and
[Git and GitHub through GitKraken : From Zero to Hero!][zeroHero] and is structured in two halves. The first goes into
greater detail solidifying the concepts around branches and how to use Git in a structured manner, termed "git hygiene",
and how to use Git hooks effectively to make sure your work is "clean". These concepts serve as a basis for the second
half of the course which covers Continuous Integration, effective reviewing and project management.

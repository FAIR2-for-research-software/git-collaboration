## Will I Ever Know it All?

Probably not. There is simply too much to Git and associated tools like GitHub/GitLab and Pre-Commit to have any hope of
knowing everything there is to about all aspects. That shouldn't dishearten you from learning what you need to as you
go.

## How can I keep on learning more about Git?

Practise makes perfect, or so the saying goes, but in the case of computing its quite true, if you don't practise using
the tools or writing code you will not improve.

## What material would you recommend?

Below there are links to a number of references, blogs, videos and so forth for finding out more about Git, GitHub and
so forth.

### References

- [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) a comprehensive book about Git, very, very detailed.
- [Learn Git - Tutorials, Workflows and Commands | Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git) excellent resources from
  Atlassian their tutorials are clear and informative and inspired much of this course.

### Videos

- [So You Think You Know Git - Scott Chacon FOSDEM 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aolI_Rz0ZqY) an excellent talk
  by one of the co-founders of GitHub.

### Blogs

Blogs are an excellent way to find out about new features. I would highly recommend using a
[RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) reader to consolidate the blogs you want to follow.

- [The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/) updates, ideas, and inspiration from GitHub.
- [GitLab Blogs](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/) various categories of blogs from GitLab.
- [Julia Evans (aka b0rk) Git Posts](https://jvns.ca/#git) useful and insightful posts on different aspects of Git that
  help tackle fundamental but often misunderstood concepts.

#### RSS Readers

- [Feeder](https://github.com/spacecowboy/Feeder) open source, private feed reader that runs on your Android device.
- [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) web-based feed aggregator.

### Mastodon

[Mastodon][mastodon] is a federated social network consisting of multiple servers that communicate with each
other. There are a lot of technical users who post their articles, ask questions and help each other out about all sorts
of languages and tools. Join an instance and follow the `#git` to keep abreast of things and find out what others
struggle with and how they can be solved.

[Fedi.Tips](https://fedi.tips/) is a useful guide to getting started with Mastodon and once you're setup it can be
useful to use the [Advanced Web
Interface](https://fedi.tips/how-to-activate-mastodons-tweetdeck-style-advanced-web-interface/) and add a column for the
`#git` tag. A good Android client is [Fedilab](https://fedilab.app/).

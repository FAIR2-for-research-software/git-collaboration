# Git Collaboration

This lesson uses [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench] to develop training material for an intermediary level course on
using Git effectively for collaboration.

## Course Description

[Git][git] is a powerful tool for distributed, collaborative and version controlled "software" development. As with any
powerful tool the amount of different options and ways of using it are many resulting in an often bewildering or
overwhelming experience for those trying to learn how to use it.

This course seeks to develop material that focuses on many tasks that make the process of _collaborating_ using
[Git][git] easier to understand.
